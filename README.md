## Project Overview


This is a simple portfolio app for my stage 2 HNG intenship task. It shows some of the projects i have worked on, my expereience, softwares i use and my social media links. The apps code base is a simple one as i did not use any architecture, all assets are in the assets folder which is in the projects root directory, i came up with the design for the app, which has my image as a background picture with a little text about myself stacked on it and a SingleChildScrollView which contains some of the projects i have worked on, clicking on any project navigates to another screen containing some images from the desin of that project, my description of work, duration of work and the softwares and languages i used while working on that project.
